# BirthdayCard

I will finish this application step by step based on the class from Udacity.

## Two ways to connect the local repo and the remote repo.
### 1. 
use git init to make the local repo as a git repo.
use git remote add -u origin url to define the remote one.
use git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin master to connect them.
use git push --set-upstream origin master to push the local changes.

### 2.
use git clone url to pull the remote one to the local.
make any change such as creating a new project in the local.
use git pull/push to change information between the local one and the remote one.

## How to make a birthday card

Use two text views and one image view to make it.

If two views are overlapping, use the relative layout.

Put images into the drawable folder. When use the image, just use its name without the suffix.
